## Overview

Riker is a framework for building modern, concurrent and resilient systems using the Rust language. Riker aims to make working with state and behavior in concurrent systems as easy and scalable as possible. The Actor Model has been chosen to realize this because of the familiar and inherent simplicity it provides while also providing strong guarantees that are easy to reason about. The Actor Model also provides a firm foundation for resilient systems through the use of the actor hierarchy and actor supervision.

Riker provides:

- An Actor based execution runtime
- Actor supervision to isolate and recover from failures
- A modular system
- A Dispatcher backed by `futures::execution::ThreadPool` by default
- Publish/Subscribe messaging via actor channels
- Message scheduling
- Out-of-the-box, configurable, non-blocking logging
- Persistent actors using Event Sourcing
- Command Query Responsiblily Separation (CQRS)
- Run futures alongside actors

## Example

`Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
riker = "0.1.6"
riker-default = "0.1.6"
```

`main.rs`:
```rust
extern crate riker;
extern crate riker_default;
#[macro_use]
extern crate log;

use std::time::Duration;
use riker::actors::*;
use riker_default::DefaultModel;

struct MyActor;

// implement the Actor trait
impl Actor for MyActor {
    type Msg = String;

    fn receive(&mut self,
                _ctx: &Context<Self::Msg>,
                msg: Self::Msg,
                _sender: Option<ActorRef<Self::Msg>>) {

        debug!("Received: {}", msg);
    }
}

// provide factory and props methods
impl MyActor {
    fn actor() -> BoxActor<String> {
        Box::new(MyActor)
    }

    fn props() -> BoxActorProd<String> {
        Props::new(Box::new(MyActor::actor))
    }
}

// start the system and create an actor
fn main() {
    let model: DefaultModel<String> = DefaultModel::new();
    let sys = ActorSystem::new(&model).unwrap();

    let props = MyActor::props();
    let my_actor = sys.actor_of(props, "my-actor").unwrap();

    my_actor.tell("Hello my actor!".to_string(), None);

    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
}
```

## Modules

Riker's core functionality is provided by modules defined as part of a 'model'. Every application defines a `Model` to describe the modules to be used. Everything from database storage, to logging, to the underlying dispatcher that executes actors is a module.

A default `Model` [riker-default](riker-default) makes it easy to get started. You can also use this default model as part of a custom model.

## Associated Projects

Official crates that provide additional functionality:

- [riker-cqrs](https://github.com/riker-rs/riker-cqrs): Command Query Responsibility Separation support
- [riker-testkit](https://github.com/riker-rs/riker-testkit): Tools to make testing easier
- [riker-patterns](https://github.com/riker-rs/riker-patterns): Common actor patterns, including `transform!` and 'ask'

## Roadmap & Currently in Development

The next major theme on the project roadmap is clustering and location transparency:

- Remote actors
- Support for TCP and UDP
- Clustering (using vector clocks)
- Distributed data (CRDTs)

## Why Riker
We believe there is no greater need than now for a full-featured actor model implementation that scales to hundreds or thousands of microservices and that equally can run exceptionally well on resource limited hardware to drive drones, IoT and robotics. The Rust language makes this possible.

## Rust Version
Riker is currnently built using the **latest Rust Nightly**. Between Riker 0.2 and 0.3 we expect to build against Rust Stable with support for specific minimum versions.

## Contributing

This project is very new. There's currently no preferred contribution process. Anyone can contribute!

Places to start are open issues and modules, such as data store modules.
